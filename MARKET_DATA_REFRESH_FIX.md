# âœ… Market Data Refresh - FIXED

## Problem
Some stocks (TSLA, NVDA) were still showing $0.00 (+0.00%) changes even though:
- Market data API was working correctly
- Real data was available (TSLA: +$19.90, +6.22%, NVDA: +$3.01, +1.72%)
- Holdings weren't being updated with current market data

## Root Cause
1. **Stale Holdings Data**: Holdings in the database were created before we added `change` and `changePercent` fields
2. **No Market Data Refresh**: Portfolio wasn't automatically refreshing holdings with current market data
3. **Missing Update Logic**: No mechanism to update existing holdings with real-time market changes

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Market Data Refresh Function
- **`refreshHoldingsWithMarketData()`**: New function to update all holdings with current market data
- **Real-time Updates**: Fetches current prices, changes, and change percentages for all holdings
- **Database Updates**: Updates holding records with latest market data

### 2. Enhanced Portfolio Refresh
- **Automatic Updates**: Portfolio refresh now includes market data updates
- **Two-step Process**: First updates holdings, then fetches portfolio with market prices
- **Real-time Changes**: Holdings now show actual market movements

### 3. Improved User Experience
- **Refresh Button**: Dashboard now has "Refresh Market Data" button
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and success messages
- **Manual Control**: Users can manually refresh market data when needed

### 4. Fixed Code Quality

- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for market data updates
- **Logging**: Added console logs for debugging and user feedback
