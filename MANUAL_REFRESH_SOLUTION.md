# ðŸ”§ Manual Holdings Refresh Solution

## Problem
TSLA and NVDA are still showing $0.00 (+0.00%) even though the market data API is working correctly.

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Use the Dashboard Refresh Button
1. **Navigate to Dashboard**: http://localhost:3001/dashboard
2. **Click "Refresh Market Data"** button
3. **Wait for the refresh to complete**
4. **Check if TSLA and NVDA now show real changes**

### Option 2: Manual Database Update (If Option 1 doesn't work)

If the refresh button doesn't work, you can manually update the holdings in your database:

1. **Open your Supabase dashboard**
2. **Go to the Table Editor**
3. **Select the `holdings` table**
4. **Find your TSLA and NVDA holdings**
5. **Manually update them with current market data:**

#### For TSLA:
- **current_price**: 340.01
- **change**: 19.9
- **changePercent**: 6.2166

#### For NVDA:
- **current_price**: 177.99
- **change**: 3.01
- **changePercent**: 1.7202

### Option 3: Add New Holdings (Alternative)

If the above doesn't work, you can:
1. **Delete the existing TSLA and NVDA holdings**
2. **Add them again using the "Add Stock" form**
3. **This will create new holdings with current market data**

## Why This Happened

The holdings were created before we added the `change` and `changePercent` fields to the database schema. The refresh function should update them, but there might be a timing issue or the refresh isn't being triggered properly.

## Verification

After applying any of the above solutions, you should see:
- **TSLA**: $340.01 (+$19.90, +6.22%)
- **NVDA**: $177.99 (+$3.01, +1.72%)

## Next Steps

Once this is fixed, the "Refresh Market Data" button should work properly for future updates. The issue was that existing holdings didn't have the new fields populated with current market data.

Try Option 1 first (Dashboard Refresh Button), and let me know if you need help with the other options!
